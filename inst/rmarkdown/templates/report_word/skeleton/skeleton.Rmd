Project title:    
Submitted to: Client names, department, school or organization    
Report prepared by: Biostatistician’s names, CIDA information^1^     
Date:   
Updates: summary of changes/updates since last report   

# Introduction
This should be an condensed version of the introduction from the exploratory report
  
- High-level overview of study design (approximately one sentence)
- Reiterate primary, secondary, exploratory, etc. outcomes
- Summary of the important results

# Method 

## Study design
  
- Study population
- Type of design of the experiment/study/survey (e.g. factorial, cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, longitudinal, stratified, clustered)
- Interventions by treatment level and administration route (if applicable) 
- Power calculation, sample size justification, etc.

## Data
- Data sources
- Methodology used to collect data
- Date/period of data collection
- Data quality –elements of data collection and pre-processing that could influence data quality
  - Data collection quality assurance - actions put in place in order to minimize bias and maximize precision at level of data collection should be described
  - Data quality checking methods (looking for outliers, illogical results, etc.)
  - If missing data were imputed, then methods used and actions taken to ensure that bias was not introduced and that variance was not compromised should be described
  - Description of methods which have been adopted to minimize the amount of missing data

## Statistical methods
  
- Exploratory methods/exploratory analysis summary
  - Approaches used (graphical, hypothesis-based (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk), expert opinions)
  - Data transformation and manipulation
- The statistical methods used to analyze the outcomes listed in the review of project
  - Could write it generally (i.e., not in reference to specific outcomes)
  - List any variables you are adjusting for in your models
  - Describe any variable selection methods that might be used
  - Modeling assumptions 
- Table 1 sometimes has p-values, but could use various methods (parametric vs. nonparametric, continuous vs. categorical, etc.) and these could be specified here
- Software used for analyses

# Results 
(write in paragraph form so that they can cut and paste into their manuscript, poster, etc.)
  
- Table 1 and primary results
- Any other relevant tables or results
- Graphical summaries
- Interpretation of the results

# Discussions 
  
- Further interpretation of the results, perhaps based on discussions with the collaborators/investigators on a project
- Limitations (i.e., sample size too small, not meeting model assumptions or other caveats to keep in mind)
- Possible next steps with future analysis

# References 
Only include relevant sources that are to be cited in their paper. 

# Appendix 
Information for the investigator to be able to reference for their own understanding. This might include extra figures, graphics, or tables, especially if there are copious amounts of output/results. If it ends up going in the paper, it should probably be moved to the sections above.
